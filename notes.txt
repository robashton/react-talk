- I am Rob Ashton
- You may remember me from past conferences such as
  - DevDay2011
  - DevDay2012
  - DevDay2013
- For those of you wondering after last time, I do now have a job - 100% remote slinging Erlang and JS and I now live in Glasgow happily with my xbox

===

What I am not going to talk about because I want to focus on the positive things...

  - The over-engineered java-wannabe that is AngularJS
  - The well meaning abstraction that is EmberJS
  - Coffeescript
  - Semicolons
  - Front-end design patterns (seriously, I just don't care)

What I am going to talk about is React and NPM and how we use these things in our products
I'm not going to dwell too much on the React 101 because that's been done to death

===================

React is beautiful

 - Minimal API surface area
  - setState
   (createComponent is going away and being replaced with "class")
 - One way data flow
  - (Can't end up in the ember spaghetti mess, binding onto binding onto binding)
 - It's just HTML
 - Presentation logic and presentation kept close together

=================



  - Data goes in, HTML gets created, diffing gets done, minimal dom changes made
