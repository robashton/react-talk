- I am Rob Ashton
- You may remember me from past conferences such as
  - DevDay2011
  - DevDay2012
  - DevDay2013
- For those of you wondering after last time, I do now have a job - 100% remote slinging Erlang and JS and I now live in Glasgow happily with my xbox

===

What I am not going to talk about because I want to focus on the positive things...

  - The over-engineered java-wannabe that is AngularJS
  - The well meaning abstraction that is EmberJS
  - Coffeescript
  - Semicolons
  - Front-end design patterns (seriously, I just don't care)

What I am going to talk about is React and NPM and how we use these things in our products
I'm not going to dwell too much on the React 101 because that's been done to death

=================== 5 minutes ==============

The goals
  - Maintain control over our application
  - Be able to pick and choose libraries for managing "stuff"
  - Testable UI (when absolutely necessary)
  - Fast rendering of views

Without React
  - NPM ALL THE THINGS
  - Mustache for pull-based templating
  - HTML munging for push-based templating (my preferred)

Quick demo (NPM + Widget)

package.json
index.js
widget/pony.js

browserify

=================== 15 minutes ======================

With React
  - NPM ALL THE THINGS
  - React for rendering (most) views

Why?

React is beautiful

 - Minimal API surface area
  - setState
   (createComponent is going away and being replaced with "class")
 - One way data flow
  - (Can't end up in the ember spaghetti mess, binding onto binding onto binding)
 - It's just HTML
 - Presentation logic and presentation kept close together

What does this look like

  - widget.jsx
  - module.exports = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
      return <p>Hello ponies</p>
    }
  })

=================== 20 minutes =================

Stick this into our demo above - browserify + reactify

=================== 25 minutes =================

Data flow in React (THIS IS THE IMPORTANT BIT)

- Props are for passing state IN and events OUT
- State is for internal concerns
- Try not to use state

- Demo of props
- Demo of state

=================== 40 minutes ===============

How about client-side routing at that point?

 - location-bar (insert npm module here)

Demo
  client-side routing

=================== 45 minutes ==============

- Things we do in React
  - Render dashboards
  - Form interaction

- Things we do outside of React
  - Client-side routing
  - Modal windows (yeah, we have those)
  - Charting
  - Track our current user environment
  - Everything else
